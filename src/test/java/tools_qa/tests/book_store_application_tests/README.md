# 📚Book Store Application – Test Documentation

## 📌Book Store tests - information

- These tests require a logged-in user
- There is no test for deleting a user, because after that a new one would have to be created manually
- When I click on the book name, a blank page opens and nothing else happens.  
  This makes larger and more thorough tests of the Book Store impossible, so I test everything I can.

## 🔐Register and Login user – details

### Test order

Due to the high instability of this test collection (depending on whether we have registered user data or not), I will
try to set the test order so that this collection is always executed last.

### Register User

`shouldCaptchaBlockUs()` – Sometimes this test will fail because reCaptcha lets us through...  
Well, that's what this test is for.

Due to the reCaptcha mechanism, it is not possible to automate full, correct user registration using Selenium.  
We will have to create an account ourselves and create an **ENV** file with its data, which will not be uploaded
to GitHub.

**We must register new user on this site:**  
https://demoqa.com/register

### User data

After registration, in the project directory we have the 📁environment directory.  
We need to create an `.env` file in it and set our registered user's data in these variables:

```.env
# book_store_application
TQ_BSA_USERNAME=yourUsername
TQ_BSA_PASSWORD=yourPassword
```

### Login user

Once we have a registered user and saved his data to the `.env` file, we can start running the test.  
In the `LoginTest.java` file, the test called `shouldLogInCorrectly()` should now execute correctly.
