# Book Store Application – Test Documentation

## Register and Login user – important details

### Test order

Due to the high instability of this test collection (depending on whether we have registered user data or not), I will
try to set the test order so that this collection is always executed last.

### Register User

Due to the reCaptcha mechanism, it is not possible to automate full, correct user registration using Selenium.  
We will have to create an account ourselves and create an ENV file with its data, which will not be uploaded to GitHub.

We must register new user on this site:
