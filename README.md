# 📑Information about this repository (for recruiters)

## 📄Description

🙋‍♂️Hello to all recruiters and I invite you to check out my repository.

Frontend tests using Selenium and Java.

This repository was created so that I could easily organize and better absorb all the knowledge acquired during **the test automation course conducted by "Sii Poland"**.  
This repository contains **frontend tests using Selenium and Java.**  
A separate repository will be allocated for **API testing using REST Assured.**

The comments in the code are in Polish because they help me remember something and make it easier to explain how something works. You can ignore them.  
Of course, I am aware that depending on the language of communication used in the project, comments should also be written in that language.
