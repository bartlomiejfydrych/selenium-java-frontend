# 📑Information about this repository (for recruiters)

## 📄Description

### Introduction

Hello to all recruiters and I invite you to check out my repository.🙋‍♂️

This repository was created so that I could easily organize and better absorb all the knowledge acquired during
**the test automation course conducted by "Sii Poland"**.

A separate repository will be allocated for **API testing using REST Assured.**

### About repository

This repository contains **Frontend Tests using Selenium and Java.**

I covered **two websites** with tests containing **different elements and mechanisms**.

I have described everything I have learned in the lower sections of this document.

*Why didn't I cover a "normal" website, e.g. an online store?*  
Because most of the steps on such a website are very simple and repeatable, so I wouldn't really learn much there.  
I'm saving such websites for learning how to write tests using BDD in the distant future.

### Additional notes

Some of the comments in the repository are in Polish, so that when I come back to it, I can more easily remember and
understand what a given piece of code was about.

There are also comments in English to explain to you (recruiters) what a given piece of code is about and why I wrote
a given method/test this way and not another.

### Description

**Tools QA** – A website for practicing interacting with various website elements, e.g. forms, alerts, checkboxes and
many others.

**Testerczaki** – Like "Tools QA" a website for practicing interacting with various website elements BUT the exercises
are done better. However, "QA Test" has exercises that "Testerczaki" do not have.

#### Book Store Application

### Testerczaki

### Solved problems

- Deleting directories from previous IDE versions in the AppData folder that were cluttering up the system drive
- Removing page elements (ads) using JavaScript that blocked access to other elements and increased test instability

## 🤡How can Frontend developer make Tester mad?

By adding on website **a lot of**:
- Tables
- Calendars (date pickers)
- Unusual windows with about:blank URL
- Nested iFrames
- Sliders
