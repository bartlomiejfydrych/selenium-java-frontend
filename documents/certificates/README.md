# 🏆Certificates - test automation (Sii Poland)

## 📄Description

I have placed here certificates of completion of the test automation course conducted by "Sii Poland".

This course consisted of 3 parts:

- **Part 1:** Basics of programming in `Java`
- **Part 2:** Writing frontend tests in `Selenium`
- **Part 3:** Writing API tests in `REST Assured`

This repository was created so that I could calmly organize and better absorb all the knowledge acquired during **the frontend test automation course using Selenium**.  
A separate repository will be allocated for **API tests using REST Assured**.
