I have placed here certificates of completion of the test automation course conducted by "Sii Poland".

The course consisted of 3 parts:

- **Part 1:** Basics of programming in `Java`
- **Part 2:** Writing frontend tests in `Selenium`
- **Part 3:** Writing API tests in `REST Assured`

This repository was created to structure and reinforce the knowledge I acquired during **the test automation course

A separate repository will be allocated for **API testing using REST Assured.**
